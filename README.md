WeatherPy contains the necessary code for generating the list of cities, as well as analyzing Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, and Cloudiness. VacationPy takes the cities from WeatherPy and maps them based on humidity, before narrowing them down to find ideal hotels around the world. Running each code file will provide visuals of the data and the associated plots.

Use the line below to import necessary libraries:
'''pip install matplotlib pandas numpy requests scipy hvplot geoviews'''
